# SentimentAnalyser
Exploring cultures of AU through Twitter Sentiment analysis

This project will explore the uptake of Twitter across the many languages and cultures of Australia. 
It will focus on the harvesting and analysis of multi-language tweets from major cities of Australia (e.g. English language Tweets where the userâ€™s profile is set to English, Spanish, German etc) 
and compare this information with broadly cultural information resources offered through organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Census 2011. 
Sentiment analysis will be undertaken to explore overall sentiment of cultures in the large and on specific topics, e.g. Sports, politics. The work will involve the use of Cloud resources offered through 
NeCTAR and the utilisation of noSQL databases such as CouchBase. 
It will explore algorithms for data analytics including ElasticSearch and MapReduce. A front end web application will be produced to visualise the data as well.
